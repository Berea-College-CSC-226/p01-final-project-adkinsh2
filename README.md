## Milestone 2: Code Setup and Issue Queue


```
    **Right now, I'm concerned that I won't be able to use test suites for testing all my code,
    as the project I am doing relies mostly on actions being performed inside a window.
    I hope that I won't have to rely on suites in order to play test my game and ensure all components work as planned.
    I feel fairly on pace right now as long as I keep my current work balance.**

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-In


**Completion Percentage**: `70%`

**Confidence**: 

```
    **So far I've been using a lot of prior knowledge from all of the other assignments in this class, but I'm
    worried that things will become too cluttered as I finish up.**

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

### User Instructions

On the starting screen, select a difficulty, which will determine the number of times you can get hit before a game over,
and the number of times the ufo has to get hit before you win.
Press start, then dodge the ufo until the laser bounces into the ufo enough times to destroy it.
